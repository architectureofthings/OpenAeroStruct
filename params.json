OpenMDAO can be easily installed by opening the Anaconda prompt, which should be located where you installed Anaconda. Once you open the prompt, enter\r\n\r\n    pip install openmdao \r\n\r\nNext, download the repository directly from this link: https://github.com/samtx/OpenAeroStruct/archive/master.zip and add the folder to your Matlab path. \r\n\r\n## Calling OpenAeroStruct coupled system modules from Matlab\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nOnce OpenMDAO and its dependencies have been installed, you can run the aerodynamics and structure modules from Matlab using wrapper functions. You need Matlab version 2014b or greater and it must be of the same architecture (either 32-bit or 64-bit) as Python installed on your system. Run `pyversion` from the Matlab console to confirm if your Matlab/Python is configured correctly. It should automatically detect the Python executable file. [Link to Matlab documentation on `pyversion`](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/pyversion.html)\r\n\r\n```\r\n>> pyversion\r\n\r\n       version: '2.7'\r\n    executable: 'C:\\Users\\samfriedman\\Anaconda2_64\\python.EXE'\r\n       library: 'C:\\Users\\samfriedman\\Anaconda2_64\\python27.dll'\r\n          home: 'C:\\Users\\samfriedman\\Anaconda2_64'\r\n      isloaded: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the Python executable isn't specified, or if you need to use a non-default Python version, then call `pyversion` followed by the full path to the executable file.\r\n\r\n    >> pyversion 'C:\\Python33\\python.exe'\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    >> pyversion '/usr/bin/python'\r\n\r\nMatlab loads the Python interpreter when a valid Python command is entered. This action sets the [`pyversion`](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/pyversion.html) output variable `isloaded` to 1. The path to the Python executable can only be changed when Python isn't loaded in Matlab. To change the path after Python is loaded you must restart Matlab.\r\n\r\nHere is an [example Python command](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/call-user-defined-custom-module.html) to use for testing:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>> N = py.list({'Jones','Johnson','James'})\r\n\r\nN = \r\n\r\n  Python list with no properties.\r\n\r\n    ['Jones', 'Johnson', 'James']\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Using the Matlab wrappers for the coupled module\r\n\r\nRefer to the Matlab script `run_coupled.m` for an example on solving the aerostructural coupled system in Matlab.\r\n\r\nTo write your own script or function, you must first call `coupled_setup.m` to create the initial wing mesh and the Python dict object containing system parameters needed for the aerodynamics and structures modules. You must specify the number of spanwise inboard and outboard points on the airplane wing as integer arguments to the function. \r\n\r\n```\r\n% Setup mesh and coupled system parameters\r\nn_inb = 4;  % number of inboard points\r\nn_outb = 6; % number of outboard points\r\n[mesh, params] = coupled_setup(n_inb, n_outb);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe points will be mirrored to the other side of the wing to produce a full mesh of N = 2(n_inb+n_outb)-3 spanwise points. Each spanwise point has two chordwise points, one of the leading edge and the other on the trailing edge of the wing. The initial mesh sets all points to an elevation of 0. The `mesh` array has shape (N, 3) with the column representing the x, y, and z coordinates in space for the wing.\r\n\r\nTo produce the array of loads on the wing, pass the wing mesh and the params dict to the `coupled_aero.m` function.\r\n\r\n```\r\nloads = coupled_aero(mesh, params);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `loads` array is an (N/2, 6) matrix of the force and moment loads on the wing applied at the control points. The control points are along each spanwise pair of points at the 0.35*chord. Columns 1-3 are the x, y, and z components of the force vectors, while columns 4-6 are the x, y, and z components of the moment vectors.\r\n\r\nTo find the new mesh based upon the aerodynamic loads, call the `coupled_struct.m` function.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmesh = coupled_struct(loads, params);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function returns the wing mesh after calculating the displacements caused by the aerodynamic loads.\r\n\r\nOther Matlab files of interest:\r\n- `draw_crm.m` makes a plot of one side of the CRM base wing.\r\n- `mat2np.m` converts a Matlab array to a Numpy ndarry.\r\n- `np2mat.m` converts a Numpy ndarry to a Matlab array.\r\n- `coupled_plotdata.m` plots the wings mesh, force vectors, and moment vectors in 3D. This is still a work in progress.\r\n\r\nFor a full example of solving the aerostructural coupled system by iterating until both arrays convergence, see the `run_coupled.m` Matlab script.\r\n",
